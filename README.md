Hybrid Renewable Energy Model to provide electricity in remote areas of Mizoram. 

# Introduction
This project focuses on developing a Hybrid Micro-Hydro and Solar Photovoltaic system in remote areas of Mizoram, India. It addresses the critical need for electricity in these regions, despite national electrification efforts.

# Background
Despite significant progress in electrifying most villages, several remote areas remain without electricity. The project emphasizes the importance of renewable energy solutions in these regions, particularly in Mizoram, where many tribal communities reside.

# Project Description
The project proposes the implementation of a hybrid renewable energy system, combining solar photovoltaic and micro-hydro power plants. This system is designed to leverage the natural resources of Mizoram to provide sustainable and clean energy.

# Methodology
The project involved a comprehensive study of geographical locations and natural resources. The methodology included data analysis of the load profile, utility requirements of villages, and planning of the hybrid system's parameters. The project also used software tools like HOMER GRID for simulation and evaluation of the optimal hybrid system configuration.

## Data Analysis
The analysis involved assessing the load profile and utility requirements of the villages, evaluating solar irradiance, and studying the water quality of the local river. Tools like MATLAB and Simulink were used for modeling.

## Results and Impact
The project provides a solution to improve the quality of life for residents in Sugarbasora and New Adam by providing reliable electricity. It supports infrastructure development in healthcare, education, and farming.

## Challenges and Solutions
One challenge is the corrosive nature of the river water, which affects the micro-hydro power plant. The solution involves using galvanized turbines for durability.

## Future Scope
The project is scalable to other similar villages in Mizoram and northeastern India. It has the potential to aid in the region's development and enhance the tourism sector.

## Conclusion
This initiative is a significant step towards sustainable rural electrification, leveraging local natural resources effectively.
